## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to take the web page and dynamic table that we had already created and make it even more interactive and include filters such as city, state, country, and shape using Javascript.


## Results:
 
To perform a search on the webpage, you can type in values for all 5 filters, like the image below to get a very specific result.

Or you can fill in just one filter, like "state" to see all the results for a certain state. This gives you more broad results.

By typing in what filters you would like to see, the data we have is presented in a table format to give you clear results.

## Summary:

One drawback of this webpage is that the filters are case-sensitive. The user has to be careful and aware that the data is lowercase despite them being cities/states/countries

Two Recommendations:
- I would recommend creating a "Filter" button rather than just hitting enter, this could confuse the user and they may be unsure of if the filter is actually working or how to start it if they don't assume to hit "enter'".
- I would also recommend returning a message of "No Matching Results" or something when there are not results for the filtered search. This could confuse the users into thinking the page is still loading, it isn't working propery or other issues. So if there was a message letting them know there are no results, they can adjust their filters.
